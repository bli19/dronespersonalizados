<h1>IAR Embedded Workbench for Eclipse (ARM 6.50.x/6.60.x/6.70.x)</h1>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<!-- JQL query: project = Eclipse AND visibility = "Public" AND component not in ("Renesas") AND (resolution in (Unresolved, "Won't Fix") OR (resolution = Fixed AND fixVersion > "6.50.x")) ORDER BY key DESC  -->
<ul>
	<li>The Compiler / Language / &#39;Auto&#39; option value does not work correctly if the project is using the GNU Makefile Builder. It will work if the Internal Builder is used. (<i>ECL-1585</i>)</li>
	<li>Binaries created via the Output Converter options are not displayed in the project Binaries group. (<i>ECL-1581</i>)</li>
	<li>Using the IAR plugins in a headless build will result in Eclipse exceptions being logged. The build will though complete normally. (<i>ECL-1576</i>)</li>
	<li>The I-jet driver in Embedded Workbench for ARM 6.50.6 does not work under Eclipse. The workaround is to use Embedded Workbench version 6.50.5, or version 6.60 and newer. (<i>ECL-1534</i>)</li>
	<li>No warning is displayed when setting a Data Log breakpoint on a 64-bit type in the I-jet driver. (<i>ECL-1494</i>)</li>
	<li><span class="error">&#91;Project importer&#93;</span> The project importer does not convert pre/post build steps. These have to be converted manually. (<i>ECL-1438</i>)</li>
	<li><span class="error">&#91;Project importer&#93;</span> When "Create links" is unchecked and the imported project contains references to <tt>$EW_DIR$</tt> or <tt>$TOOLKIT_DIR$</tt>, the resulting paths in the Eclipse project may become excessively long, including path elements from the root of the drive. (<i>ECL-1437</i>)</li>
	<li>The Trace Start / Stop / Filter breakpoint types do not work correctly when using the JTAGjet driver. (<i>ECL-1400</i>)</li>
	<li>[I-jet] The memory configuration dialog is not implemented. As a side-effect of this, the memory cache is disabled, as it requires the memory configuration dialog to be available. (<i>ECL-1390</i>)</li>
	<li>The &#39;Clean Project&#39; command might not remove other temporary files which are generated during the build, like list (.lst) and preprocessor files (.i). A workaround is to delete the entire build output folder manually. (<i>ECL-1296</i>)</li>
	<li>Double quote characters are removed from preprocessor symbol definitions because of a CDT bug, see <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=309158">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=309158</a> (<i>ECL-1212</i>)</li>
	<li>When the "@" placement operator is used in a declaration, the CDT Indexer will also report a dummy <tt>char * @</tt> variable declaration after it. (<i>ECL-1193</i>)</li>
	<li>The 'Explore Macro Expansion' functionality in CDT will expand extended keywords occurring in macros as empty strings. In order to see the extended keywords used in a macro, you have to navigate to its definition in the source code. (<i>ECL-1119</i>)</li>
	<li>Output to the standard error stream (stderr) does not work. Any output printed to stderr will appear in the console as if written to stdout. This affects redirecting streams to file as well. (<i>ECL-1114</i>)</li>
	<li>To prevent deadlocks, all commands sent to the debugger <em>while the debugged program reads from stdin</em> will now <b>fail</b>. This means that all actions which require interacting with the debugger will be unavailable while the target is reading from stdin (debugger run/step buttons will not work, breakpoints cannot be set/modified, and views will not display any useful data). (<i>ECL-1107</i>)</li>
	<li>Members of anonymous struct and union declarations are not resolved by the CDT code indexer, so auto-completion will not work on them. Also, the CDT Static Analysis tool might report spurious error messages about unresolved symbols (building the project will work correctly, but the errors will not disappear). To prevent the error message from appearing, turn off unresolved symbols warnings using <b>Window&gt;Preferences&gt;C/C++&gt;Code Analysis&gt;Syntax and Semantic Errors&gt;Symbol is not resolved</b>. (<i>ECL-1075</i>)</li>
	<li>The "Terminate and Relaunch" command only works when the root node of a launch is selected. (<i>ECL-934</i>)</li>
	<li>The C-SPY debugger plugin can only be used to debug projects built using the IAR toolchain for ARM. Binary-only debugging is not supported. (<i>ECL-895</i>)</li>
	<li>Changing the language in IAR Embedded Workbench for Windows may cause garbled terminal I/O console output in Eclipse. (<i>ECL-828</i>)</li>
	<li>The CDT Variables view might not display a parent class correctly in some cases. Use the C-SPY Locals view instead. (<i>ECL-740</i>)</li>
	<li>Plugins are not signed. (<i>ECL-594</i>)</li>
	<li>Custom source file extensions are not supported (<i>ECL-521</i>)</li>
	<li>List files (.lst), map files (.map) and other additional artifacts generated during a build might not be displayed in the Eclipse project after a successful build. They will be displayed if a project refresh is started manually after building. (<i>ECL-277</i>)</li>
	<li>The CDT indexer does not fully support IAR language extensions. (<i>ECL-248</i>)</li>
</ul>
