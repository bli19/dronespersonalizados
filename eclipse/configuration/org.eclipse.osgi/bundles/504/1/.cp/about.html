2. Term of agreement 

2.1 This Agreement shall become effective on the latest at the 
Licensee's receipt of the Software and shall remain in effect for an 
indefinite period in time, subject to the terms and conditions set out 
below - in particular the right of IAR Systems to terminate the 
Agreement upon Licensee's breach. Registration of the Licensee as a 
rightful user of Licensed Products shall be made in accordance with 
applicable instructions from IAR Systems. 

2.2 For the avoidance of doubt: Also for Software delivered with a 
temporary license key (for some products called quick start key) 
enabling use for a limited time, the Agreement terms have become 
effective, including but not limited to its payment terms and use 
restrictions, already upon the Licensee's receipt of the Software, 
regardless of whether registration is made or not. (Evaluation licenses 
without obligation to pay license fees, are available to the extent 
separately provided by IAR Systems.) 

3. Ownership and license grant 

3.1 IAR Systems holds the copyright, trade secrets, and any other 
intellectual property rights which subsist in the Licensed Product and 
all copies thereof. No title or other rights in the Licensed Product 
(other than rights expressly granted herein) shall pass to the Licensee. 

The Product is licensed, not sold, to the LICENSEE FOR use only under 
the terms of this agreement. THE Licensee acknowledgES that the Product 
consists of proprietary, unpublished products of IAR Systems, protected 
under international copyright and trade secret laws. 

3.2 PC-locked License; To the extent the relevant license granted is a 
PC-locked License, the terms in 3.2.a and 3.2.b shall apply. 

A PC-locked License is a single-user license, locked to the computer 
where the software is installed. 

3.2.a Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, IAR Systems 
hereby grants to the Licensee a personal, non-transferable and 
non-exclusive PC-locked License to use the Software. The Licensee's 
number of authorized users of the Software under the PC-locked License, 
if more than one, is stated in the Invoice or otherwise in writing from 
IAR Systems. 

3.2.b The PC-locked License may be used by the Licensee only on one 
single, self-contained computer unit (stationary or portable), 
designated through its IP number or other means of identification. A 
switch of the designated computer to another single computer may be 
allowed to transfer the license via a transfer program provided by IAR 
Systems within the license management system. The Software may not be 
accessed by users from other computer units than the unit designated as 
set forth in this clause; through modem, Internet or any other means of 
network or remote access. 

3.3 Mobile License: To the extent the relevant license granted is a 
Mobile License, the terms in 3.2.a and 3.2.b shall apply. 

A Mobile License comes with a hardware lock (dongle). A hardware lock is 
a device to be attached to one of the computer's external ports, which 
allows the Licensee to move the license to another computer. A hardware 
lock is part of the product package only to the extent explicitly 
ordered. 3.3.b The Mobile License may be used by the Licensee only for 
one single user, but with the right to a switch of the designated 
computer to another single computer using a hardware lock. The Software 
may not be accessed by users from other computer units than the unit 
designated as set forth in this clause; through modem, Internet or any 
other means of network or remote access. 

3.4 Multi-user License; To the extent the Product license granted is a 
Multi-user License, the terms in 3.4.a and 3.4.b shall apply. 

3.4.a Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, IAR Systems 
hereby grants to the Licensee a personal, non-transferable and 
non-exclusive Multi-user License to use the Software. The Licensee's 
number of authorized users of the Software under the Multi-user License, 
if more than one, is stated in the Invoice or otherwise in writing from 
IAR Systems or IAR Distributors. 

3.4.b The Network License may be used by the Licensee only on the single 
designated server on one Site for the number of simultaneously 
authorized users. 

3.5 A Network License is a Multi-user License, located on a license 
server and used by multiple users on a network and on one Site only. The 
Network License is locked either to the computer where the license 
server software runs, or to a hardware lock (dongle). The use of a 
hardware lock allows to move the Network License to another server 
computer, in case of server failure. The Network License can be used on 
all client computers on the network where the Software is installed. 
However, the Network License is made for a maximum number of concurrent 
users. 

3.6 Concurrent Users; For Products that are Executable Software and 
licensed as Network Licenses, the definition of concurrency is given by 
the license server software, which also keeps track of the number of 
current of users. A user session of an Executable Software is always a 
minimum of thirty (30) minutes, and is deemed to last for additional 
thirty (30) minutes after the last license activation by the license 
server. For Products including Software Source Code, the software shall 
be deemed in (concurrent) use on a computer when it is loaded into 
temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g., 
hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage device) of that computer. 

3.7 Source Code License: If the Product Licensee receives hereunder 
contained software modules or components in source code format 
("Software Source Code"), the following shall apply to such Software 
Source Code, in addition to all other provisions of this Agreement: The 
Licensee may use such Software Source Code only in conjunction with the 
Product and the Software Source Code or any derivative works thereof. 
The Software Source Code may only be compiled and linked with products 
from IAR Systems, and only in accordance with the provisions on such use 
set out in the Documentation and/or this Agreement. The Licensee is 
strictly prohibited to make any other use of the Software Source Code. 
Any breach of this Section 3.7 shall be considered a material breach of 
this Agreement. 

THE Licensee acknowledges that the Software Source Code embeds 
copyrighted and propriety information of IAR Systems, and that making 
Software Source Code accessible to others outside the scope of this 
Agreement, by the nature of source code, severely damages the 
intellectual property RIGHTS of IAR Systems, AND AGREES TO COMPENSATE 
IAR FOR ALL DAMAGE RESULTING FROM SUCH BREACH, THAT CAN BE REASONABLY 
SUBSTANTIATED BY IAR. The Licensee shall keep and protect the Software 
Source Code with at least the same degree of care as its own proprietary 
source code, as further specified in section 5. 

3.8 Back-up Copies: The Licensee may make back-up copies of the Software 
in machine executable code form, only to be used in the event and to the 
extent that the copy of the Software received from IAR Systems fails to 
function, is lost, damaged, or destroyed. The Licensee warrants that it 
will make no other copies of the Software and will not allow, authorize, 
or assist others to copy any part or all of the Software in any form 
without the prior written approval of IAR Systems. There may be no more 
copies than are necessary to form part of a reasonable back-up cycle for 
the Licensee. Back-up copies of the Software may be kept by the Licensee 
in a bank deposit or other such secure place as is normally used by the 
Licensee for storage of its computer program back-ups. The rights for 
the Licensee under this section shall not in any case include any 
measures to affect or decrease the function of the software protection 
included in the software. 

4. LICENSE RESTRICTIONS 

4.1 The Licensee may not remove, make emulation, reverse engineer, 
decompile, or disassemble the Executable Software. Licensee is not 
allowed to derive the source or assembly code of files provided in 
executable or object formats. The Licensee accepts that all information 
gained about the Software is the valuable intellectual property of IAR 
Systems and as such must be treated as confidential as described under 
Article 5. The Licensee warrants that it will not sell, license, lease, 
rent, loan, lend, transmit, network, communicate, or otherwise 
distribute or transfer the Software in any manner to any third party 
whether on a permanent or temporary basis, except as explicitly stated 
in this Agreement. Furthermore the Licensee warrants that it will not 
use or permit the use of (including without limitation by time sharing 
or network use) the Software for the benefit of any entity other than 
the Licensee; or in a computer service business; make unauthorized 
copies of the documentation; make verbal or media translations of the 
documentation; make telecommunications data transmissions of the 
Software; use long-haul gateways on any central processing unit on which 
the Software is used. The Licensee is also expressly prohibited from 
adapting, modifying, revising, improving, upgrading, enhancing, and 
creating derivative works of the Executable Software for any purpose 
including error correction or any other type of maintenance. 

4.2 The Licensee shall keep records of the Licensee's use of Software. 
The Licensee shall make the records available to either IAR Systems or a 
neutral third party on reasonable notice, as agreed between the parties. 
In the case of a neutral third party audit, IAR Systems and Licensee 
shall in good faith mutually appoint an auditor. Should such an 
agreement not be reached within 60 days after IAR Systems notice, then 
the parties agree to have Business Software Alliance conduct such an 
audit, or itself elect an auditor. The Licensee will permit IAR Systems 
or a third party, as the case may be, to have access to the Licensee's 
records and computer systems and to use software audit tools on the 
Licensee's systems to ensure that the Licensee is using its software 
in accordance with the applicable license terms. Upon the Licensee's 
request, the party conducting the audit with the Licensee shall enter 
into a non-disclosure agreement with the Licensee, to protect the 
Licensee's propriety and/or confidential information. Information 
retrieved and/or conveyed to IAR Systems as a result of such an audit as 
here described shall be limited as to only ensure that the Licensee is 
using its software in accordance with the applicable license terms, or 
evidence of the contrary. 

4.3 Subject to the other terms herein, and with the Licensee as fully 
responsible for all actions or omissions of such a consultant, Licensee 
may let a consultant use the Software for work solely on behalf of the 
Licensee for the licensed purpose and provided that the Software is not 
used for any other purpose or third party. 

4.4 Upon each and every breach by the Licensee hereunder a contractual 
penalty amounting to 200% for breach under sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 
3.8, 4.1 or 4.3 and 1000% for breach under section 3.7 of the applicable 
licensee fee under the relevant Invoice is payable by the Licensee to 
IAR Systems. In case IAR Systems' actual damage due to the breach 
would exceed this amount, also the remainder shall be paid by the 
Licensee, see also Section 3.7. 

5. CONFIDENTIALITY 

5.1 The Licensee agrees that all material and information relating to 
the Software is made available for the use solely under and in 
accordance with this Agreement. The Licensee has no right at any time 
during or after cancellation or termination of this Agreement to 
disclose such material and/or information relating to the Software, 
whether directly or indirectly, to any third party without IAR 
Systems' prior written approval. The Licensee shall hold harmless, 
defend, and indemnify IAR Systems from and against any and all losses, 
costs, damages, and expenses arising out of or in connection with the 
Licensee's failure to comply with requirements of this Article 5. The 
Licensee's confidentiality obligations hereunder shall survive 
cancellation or termination, for any reason, of this Agreement. 

6. PAYMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

6.1 In consideration of the rights granted and services rendered by IAR 
Systems under this Agreement, the Licensee shall pay the license fees 
for the Software as specified in the Invoice. Payments are to be made 
according to the payment schedule stated in the Invoice, or if not 
stated, invoices are payable within 30 days of the invoice date. 

6.2 If the Licensee fails to effect payment within the stipulated time, 
IAR Systems or IAR Distributors shall be entitled to a) charge interest 
after due date as stated in the Invoice, or if not stated in the 
invoice, the interest charged will be the reference rate set by 
Sweden's central bank (the Riksbank) + 8%. b) postpone the fulfilment 
of any of its own obligations until payment is made, and/or c) terminate 
the Agreement by notice in writing to the Licensee and recover from the 
Licensee any and all loss incurred. 

6.3 All prices are exclusive of, and the Licensee is responsible for, 
all fees and taxes, including custom duties, importation fees, sales, 
use, withholding, gross revenue, and like taxes, dues, and charges 
assessed or incurred in connection with the provision of goods and 
services under this Agreement. 

7. LIMITED WARRANTY 

7.1 IAR Systems warrants that the media on which the Software is 
recorded upon receipt by the Licensee will be free from defects in 
materials and faulty workmanship under normal use for a period of ninety 
(90) days from the date of delivery to the Licensee. During this 
warranty period IAR Systems will, at its option, after its receipt of 
the media in return, repair or replace, free of charge, defective media 
upon which the Software was supplied and record a copy of the Software 
on the repaired or replacement media. Said repair or replacement shall 
be the Licensee's exclusive remedy under this media warranty. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, IAR Systems shall have no responsibility 
to repair or replace a media which, in IAR Systems' opinion, has been 
damaged by the Licensee by accident, abuse, or as a result of attempted 
self-maintenance service. 

7.2 IAR Systems does not warrant that the Software will meet the 
Licensee's requirements or that the operation of the Software will be 
uninterrupted and error free. The Licensee is solely responsible for the 
selection of the Software to achieve its intended results or for the 
results actually obtained. 

7.3 The above warranty does not apply to conditions resulting from 
improper use, external causes, including service or modifications not 
performed by IAR Systems or a contractor appointed by IAR Systems, or 
operation outside the specified environmental parameters. IAR Systems 
will not be responsible for operation of the Software other than on the 
host equipment specified in the Invoice and in conjunction with the 
operating environment designated for each version of the Software. Minor 
deviations from the above warranty, which are of little importance for 
the intended use of the Software and which do not cause more than minor 
inconvenience for the Licensee shall not be considered as breaches of 
the above warranty. 

7.4 THE ABOVE WARRANTY IS IAR SYSTEMS' ONLY WARRANTY WITH REGARD TO 
THE SOFTWARE AND THIS AGREEMENT AND, SAVE AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, 
NO OTHER WARRANTY OR CONDITION, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, WILL APPLY, AND 
THE LICENSEE WILL NOT RAISE ANY OTHER CLAIMS BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OR 
LACK OF PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. IAR SYSTEMS SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES 
ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR UNDERTAKINGS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED 
OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ABILITY TO ACHIEVE 
A PARTICULAR RESULT, OR OF ANY OTHER WARRANTY OBLIGATION ON THE PART OF 
IAR SYSTEMS. 

7.5 IAR Systems expressly disclaims any liability for any hardware or 
software solutions at the Licensee which may affect the performance of 
the Software, including but not limited to network configurations. 

7.6 The provisions of this Article 7 shall survive any expiration or 
termination of this Agreement. 

8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT 

8.1 IAR Systems will in the way set out in 8.2, and subject to all 
limitations therein, act on any action brought against the Licensee to 
the extent it is based on a claim that the Software as it exists on the 
date of the Invoice infringes any patent or copyright duly issued under 
the laws of the country under which IAR Systems or the Licensee is 
organized. 

8.2 IAR Systems shall, in the way set out below, as sole remedy, act on 
a third-party claim that the Software infringes the intellectual 
property rights of such party, provided that IAR Systems is given prompt 
notice of such claim and is given information, reasonable assistance, 
and sole authority to defend or settle the claim. IAR Systems may at its 
option obtain the right for the Licensee to continue using the 
infringing IAR Product, replace or modify the infringing Product until 
it becomes non-infringing, or if such replacement or modification is not 
reasonably available, terminate this license with respect to the 
infringing Product and provide for a reasonable refund of fees paid by 
the Licensee to IAR Systems for the IAR Product so affected. 

8.3 IAR Systems shall not have any liability if the alleged infringement 
arises out of unauthorized use of the Software, postdelivery, non-IAR 
Systems modifications, or the combination with other products or devices 
not furnished by IAR Systems. THE OBLIGATIONS STATED IN THIS SECTION ARE 
IAR SYSTEMS' SOLE LIABILITIES AND THE LICENSEE'S SOLE REMEDIES FOR 
INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT: THE 
LIABILITY OF IAR SYSTEMS UNDER THIS SECTION 8 MAY NEVER EXCEED THE 
LICENSE FEE PAID BY THE LICENSEE. 

9. FORCE MAJEURE 

9.1 Either party shall be excused from fulfilment of any obligation 
under this Agreement only to the extent that and for so long as such 
performance is prevented or delayed by an industrial dispute or any 
other cause beyond its reasonable control, such as, but not limited to, 
riots; floods; war; warlike hostilities; fires; embargo; shortage of 
labor, power, fuel, means of transportation, or common lack of other 
necessities. A party wishing to claim relief under this Article shall 
forthwith notify the other party in writing on the intervention and on 
the cessation of such circumstance. 

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 

10.1 THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND ALL CONSEQUENCES ARISING THEREFROM IS

INDIRECTLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE, THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, OR 
OTHERWISE. 

10.2 IAR SYSTEMS' LIABILITY VIS-À-VIS THE LICENSEE UNDER THIS 
AGREEMENT SHALL UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIMITED TO FIFTY (50) PER 
CENT OF THE LICENSE FEE FOR THE SOFTWARE PAID BY THE LICENSEE HEREUNDER, 
PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT IF SECTION 8 IS APPLICABLE THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF 
IAR SYSTEMS HEREUNDER MAY INSTEAD NEVER EXCEED 100% OF THE LICENSE FEE 
PAID BY THE LICENSEE HEREUNDER FOR SUCH SOFTWARE. 

10.3 IAR SYSTEMS SHALL IN NO EVENT BE LIABLE TO THE LICENSEE UNDER THIS 
AGREEMENT FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, SUCH AS LOSS OF DATA, USE AND/OR 
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR DOWNTIME COSTS AND CAPITAL COSTS OR 
CLAIM OF THIRD PARTY, WHETHER ON ACCOUNT OF DEFECTS, PERFORMANCES, 
NON-PERFORMANCES, DELAYS, PERSONAL INJURIES, PROPERTY DAMAGES, OR 
OTHERWISE, REGARDLESS WHETHER IAR SYSTEMS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

10.4 NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT THE LIABILITY 
UNDER APPLICABLE COMPULSORY LAW OF IAR SYSTEMS FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL 
INJURY RESULTING FROM ITS NEGLIGENCE. 

10.5 The provisions of this Article 10 shall survive the cancellation or 
termination of this Agreement.
